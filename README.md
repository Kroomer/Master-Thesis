**# Master-Thesis**

*Repository for master thesis - Data Science & Society*

This repository contains the outputted results for each individual model run in the experiments, as well as the plots present in this thesis (see appendices). 

The .R file to create the replicated dataset from Coerver (2020) is available in addition to the pre-downloaded datasets used to replicate the extracted dataset. 


All code is provided by comments to read, understand and replicate the experiments.
