**Master-Thesis**

*Repository for master thesis - Data Science & Society*

This repository contains the outputted results for each individual model run in the experiments, as well as the plots present in this thesis (see appendices) 
 \
 \
 \
The .R file to create the replicated dataset from Coerver (2020) is available in addition to the pre-downloaded datasets used to replicate the extracted dataset \
